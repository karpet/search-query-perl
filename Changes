    - SWISH dialect does not (as SQL dialect does)
      expand to all defined if fields if 'default_field' is not
      specified.
    - add translate_to() method to base Dialect class.

0.09 2010-03-03
    - fix bug in sqd where default_field was not also setting fields.
    - POD fixes.

0.10 2010-03-14
    - fix (NOT query) bug.
    - add range support to SQL dialect.

0.11 2010-03-26
    - add proximity support.

0.13 2010-04-10
    - fix bug with stringification of SWISH dialect and compound negatives.
    - fix bug in Dialect->add_sub_clause()

0.14 2010-04-30
    - add !: operator support to Parser
    - fix Dialect->add_*_clause methods to properly add () around 
      the existing and new clauses, to get logical groupings correct.
    - add stringify() method to Clause
    - add clear_error() method to Parser
    - fix bug where expanded alias_for field array was not passing
      through quote or proximity values.

0.15 2010-05-06
    - add sanity check in Parser so that stringify() is tested. If a parsed
      query cannot be re-parsed after stringify() then the stringify() method
      is broken.

0.16 2010-05-08
    - fix uninitialized value warning in Clause->stringify

   
0.17 2010-06-22
    - add field=(a..b) regex case to Parser so that the Clause is not stored
      as a child of a () Clause.
    - simplify the preservation of () clauses.

0.18 2010-07-25
    - add Parser->term_expander feature
    - refactor Dialect->tree() and ->translate_to() methods to avoid dependency
      on Clone module. This also fixes a segfault when calling those methods
      on objects that contain blessed C pointers,
      like Search::Query::Dialect::KSx.
